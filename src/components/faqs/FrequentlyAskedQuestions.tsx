            The notebook consists of 2 seamless volumes, a product that is
            separated into 2 so that the notebook is not too thick, which can
            make writing difficult. So using only 1 book makes your experience
            incomplete.

            Topics are arranged in a deliberate order, but there are no rules

            1 first and exercise 2 later.

            Any time that suits your life. When starting out, you can try
            journaling at different times of the week, in the morning before
            starting the day, during your lunch break, or before going to bed.
            Once you find a time that feels best, stick to it to help you get
            into a routine and understand when you get the most benefit from
            writing down your thoughts and feelings.

            Don not worry, this will happen at some point. On days when you do
            not feel like doing self-inquiry, just check in with yourself,
            identify your emotions, pay attention to your needs, and practice
            gratitude. Never force yourself to write. Just note down your
            feelings that day to understand why you can not or do not want to
            write. This will be helpful when you will review the exercises at
            another time. And give yourself a break.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, do not avoid difficult questions. Take time to reflect and
            dig deeper into the reasons behind your emotions whenever possible.
